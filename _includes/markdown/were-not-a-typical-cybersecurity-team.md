## We’re not a typical cybersecurity team

We're a community of developers, engineers, and program managers whose work has implications across the entire
connected world.  We work big and fast—what we do today affects millions of our customers and billions of
transactions tomorrow.  And our work must be seamless and simple so security is easy and doesn’t get in the way.

People who thrive in our team have a few key characteristics, including:
* __A security mindset.__ They have insatiable curiosity and a drive for finding, breaking, and fixing things.
* __Eagerness to learn.__ They may not know everything, but they enthusiastically dive into anything.
* __An evangelist’s spirit.__ They understand security isn't about ivory towers and enforcement but rather an opportunity to enable teammates and colleagues.
* __Something to share.__ They view cybersecurity as a bigger cause and make contributions to the open source community.

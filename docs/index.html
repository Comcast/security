        <p>We design our networks and products to be secure, and reinforce with multiple layers of security. Two groups are dedicated to 24/7 monitoring and response -- the Security Incident Response Team and the Security Operations Center. We meet with developers to onboard Secure development practices, as well as perform various assessments throughout our enterprise.<br><br>Once we respond to an incident, we put controls in place to protect against future similar incidents. Ultimately, security is about identifying and managing risk, which falls to our Global Risk and Compliance teams.</p>

The challenge is how to provide the best customer and employee experience, while making sure that the experience is secure. We want security to be invisible and not get in anyone's way.<br><br>Building a culture of security across Comcast ensures that our people, processes, and technology can adapt to meet current and future security challenges.</p>
